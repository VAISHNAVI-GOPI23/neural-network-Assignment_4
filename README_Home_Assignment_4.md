### 1. GAN Architecture (Theory)
- **Goal of Generator:** Generate data indistinguishable from real data.
- **Goal of Discriminator:** Distinguish between real and generated data.
- They improve through a **min-max game**, where:
  - Generator tries to fool the discriminator.
  - Discriminator gets better at detecting fakes.

                    Predicts Real (1) or Fake (0)


### 2. Ethics and AI Harm

**Harm Selected:** Misinformation in Generative AI  
**Example:** AI-generated fake news articles during elections.  
**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. Include watermarking in generated content.
2. Add fact-checking layers in deployment pipelines.

### 3. Programming Task â€“ Basic GAN (PyTorch)

- Implemented a basic GAN to generate handwritten digits using MNIST.
- Includes:
  - Generator and Discriminator architectures
  - Training loop with loss plots
  - Epoch 0, 50, and 100 sample generations

ðŸ“‚ Code: `gan_mnist_colab.ipynb`  
ðŸ“¸ Sample images & loss plots are embedded in the notebook.

### 4. Programming Task â€“ Data Poisoning on Sentiment Classifier

- A simple sentiment classifier was trained on a movie review dataset.
- Labels about "UC Berkeley" were flipped in poisoned data.
- Impact:
  - Accuracy decreased significantly.
  - Confusion matrix shifted with increased misclassifications.

ðŸ“‚ Code: `data_poisoning_simulation.ipynb`  
ðŸ“ˆ Includes before/after graphs.

### 5. Legal and Ethical Implications of GenAI

- **Concerns:**
  - Models memorizing private data (e.g., names in GPT-2)
  - Generating copyrighted material (e.g., Harry Potter)
- **Opinion:** Yes, GenAI models should be restricted from such data to avoid IP/legal violations and protect privacy.

### 6. Bias & Fairness Tools â€“ Aequitas

**Metric Chosen:** False Negative Rate Parity  
- **Measures:** If FNR is equal across demographic groups.
- **Importance:** Prevents unfair denial of benefits (e.g., loans).
- **Failure Scenario:** One group may get unfairly high rejection rates.

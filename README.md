# ðŸ§ 3. Basic GAN on MNIST using PyTorch

This project implements a simple **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** to generate handwritten digits similar to those in the MNIST dataset.

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

Train a GAN consisting of a **Generator** and **Discriminator**:
- The **Generator** learns to produce realistic digit images from random noise.
- The **Discriminator** learns to distinguish between real MNIST digits and fake ones generated by the Generator.

The two models improve through **adversarial training**, making the Generator produce increasingly convincing images.

# ðŸ§ª 4.Data Poisoning Simulation on Sentiment Classifier

This project simulates a **data poisoning attack** on a basic sentiment analysis classifier. The goal is to demonstrate how flipping labels of specific training data (e.g., mentions of "UC Berkeley") can degrade a modelâ€™s performance.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

- Train a baseline sentiment classifier on a small movie review dataset.
- Simulate a **targeted poisoning attack** by flipping sentiment labels for a subset of data.
- Measure and visualize how this attack affects model accuracy and confusion matrix.
